Tomorrow TODO --> 
Hook up copiolet
Hook up delete route

Code Review Activity:
    Postman scripting and configuration



IDEA: refactor the delete route to delete a single item, this will give us status success or status error
for each individual item


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent
Database atomic transaction - either all occur or none occur - create such that if it fails nothing happens
ACID 

easier approach to handle batch deleting on the front end requesting to delete multiple items
calling delete route multiple times 

It wont return multiple 500 errors, if you did one operation per delete you could get a 500 per delete




Postman Steps to set up environment variable:
1. go to Environments
2. create new variable 
3. 2 ways to set the value
    a) Set programmatically: go to the request that will use the variable 
        > go to Scripts > Post-response > set environment variable 
    b) Set manually in environment variables
4. refer to the variable using {{nameOfVariable}}
